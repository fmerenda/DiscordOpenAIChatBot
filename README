This is a very simple chatbot for discord that calls the openai stack and 
has a conversation with you, almost exactly like the ChatGPT chat bot. It
calls the "text-davinci-003" model from openai. The only difference I can 
see is that it won't remember context.

To use it I would update some stuff, like get your keys from the env 
variables. This is just to keep it as simple as possible for now.

Written using discord.py

You will have to add your **discord bot token*** and your **openai key** to the bot file.

requirements:
- pip install discord
- pip install openai

to run, just python3 main.py

The default activation prompt is ">", i.e. 
type ">write me a story" to have the bot send you a story.
